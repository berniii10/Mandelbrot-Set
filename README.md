This mini-project relates to the Mandelbrot set (after the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot), which leads to compelling two-dimensional fractal patterns.
The Mandelbrot Algorithm can require a lot of computation and in this project, different methods are going to be applied to approach this problem as well as a comparison of which one has a better performance.
These methods are: Naive, where traditional loops are going to be used, Numpy, where the use of the numpy library is going to be used and the same is going to be with Numba, and finally multiprocessing.
